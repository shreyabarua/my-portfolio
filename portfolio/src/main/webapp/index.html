      <img src="/images/shreya.jpg" alt="Here's a picture of me" width="250" height="190">
      <p>Hi, I'm Shreya! I'm a current computer science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institue
          in Troy, New York. This summer I'm interning at Google as part of the 
          <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/" target = "_blank">STEP</a> 
          program. This portfolio website is one of the first projects I'll
          be working on this summer. Aside from coding, I enjoy cooking, baking, and listening
          to music. When I'm not self isolating during quarantine, I also like hanging out with my friends
          and trying out new places to eat. Hope you enjoy finding a little glimpse into my life
          through this website :) </p>

      <h3> Automatcher </h3>
      <h5> May 2019 - August 2019 </h5>
      <img src="/images/cplusplus.png" alt="c++ libraries logo" width="150" height="75">
      <p><i> What is Automatcher?</i></p>
      <p> As an intern on Google's C++ Libraries team, my podmate and I
          worked on a tool called 
          <a href = "https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1aE6I6ZWN_BtyMYhmrPpYq-xEJz8Xrka_4Fj0mS_dqOk/edit#slide=id.p" target = "_blank">Automatcher</a>
          . Automatcher is an AST matcher tool which
          generates clang queries from user-provided code snippets. Usually complex queries
          need to be written out by hand, but Automatcher automates this process. </p>
      <i> What I did: </i>
      <ul>
      <li> Took ownership of the "hint" based approach to solving the problem of generating 
          an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) matcher from a user-friendly specification. </li>
      <li>Implemented support for three different methods of annotating code fragments to guide generation of 
          the AST matcher using C++. </li>
      <li>Led the design and implementation of the first version of 
          the essential data structure for representing "choice" in a code description.</li>
      </ul>

      <p><i> What is The Geo Effect? </i></p>
      <p>The Geo Effect is a climate change awareness website I worked on as part of
          the <a href="https://girlswhocode.com/" target = "_blank">Girls Who Code</a> Summer Immersion Program. </p>
      <i>What I did:</i>
      <p> Contributed to the backend of the website in implementing a blog for users to 
          share their views on climate change.</p>
