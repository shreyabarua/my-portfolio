      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Shreya! I'm a current computer science major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institue
          in Troy, New York. This summer I'm interning at Google as part of the 
          <a href="https://buildyourfuture.withgoogle.com/programs/step/" target = "_blank">STEP</a> 
          program. This portfolio website is one of the first projects I'll
          be working on this summer. Aside from coding, I enjoy cooking, baking, and listening
          to music. When I'm not self isolating during quarantine, I also like hanging out with my friends
          and trying out new places to eat. Hope you enjoy finding a little glimpse into my life
          through this website :) </p>
